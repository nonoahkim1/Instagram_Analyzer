## Overview

The Instagram Analyzer is a comprehensive web-based application designed to provide deep insights into various aspects of an Instagram account's activity. This project leverages user data exported from Instagram, allowing users to analyze their connections and activities in a structured and meaningful way.

## Key Features

### Activities
* Visualize and analyze the **comments you've posted on your own content or on other people's content** with options to sort by newest, oldest, and alphabetical, filter by years, and search by media owner and username.

### Unsupported by Native Instagram:
* Viewing Timestamps: Detailed timestamps for each category of users.
* People Not Following You Back: Identify users who do not follow you back.
